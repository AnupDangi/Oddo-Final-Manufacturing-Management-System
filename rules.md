Yes—the problem asks for a modular Manufacturing Execution-style application that digitizes the complete flow from product recipe (BOM) to production orders, work execution, and inventory postings with real-time dashboards for visibility and control across roles like managers, operators, inventory, and admins. In practice, it integrates BOM-driven MOs and WOs, work-center execution, automatic issues/receipts via stock ledger or backflush, and KPI dashboards with status filtering to replace spreadsheets and manual tracking.[1][2][3][4]

### Goal
Build a unified system that manages end-to-end manufacturing: define BOMs, create MOs, generate and execute WOs at work centers, and keep inventory accurate via a stock ledger or backflushing, all surfaced on dashboards with KPIs and filters. The purpose is to eliminate fragmented tools and manual paperwork by centralizing production planning, execution, and reporting into one application with role-based views and real-time metrics.[5][6][4][1]

### Target users
- Manufacturing managers plan and oversee production by creating MOs, sequencing work, and tracking progress through order states and routing steps.[2][1]
- Operators execute WOs at specific work centers, updating status (start, pause, complete) and time so supervisors can monitor throughput and delays.[7][8]
- Inventory managers reconcile component issues and finished-good receipts, often via backflush at completion, maintaining an auditable stock ledger.[3][9]
- Admins and owners monitor dashboards and KPIs like OEE, downtime, inventory turns, and yields for performance and decision-making.[6][10]

### Core objects and definitions
- Bill of Materials (BOM): the product’s recipe listing components and often routing operations that define how a finished good is built.[4][11]
- Manufacturing Order (MO): an authorization to produce a defined quantity of a product using specified materials, resources, and schedule.[1][2]
- Work Order (WO): the executable task for each operation in the routing, detailing steps, materials, labor, and the assigned work center.[7][1]
- Work Center: the machine, area, or team where a WO runs; used for capacity, costing, and scheduling.[2][1]
- Stock Ledger and Backflush: the evidence of all issues and receipts; backflush deducts components automatically upon completion rather than at each step to reduce manual postings.[9][3]

### End-to-end flow
- Authentication leads to a dashboard showing all MOs with filters by state (planned, in progress, done, canceled) so the team sees priorities at a glance.[5][6]
- Creating an MO selects a finished product and quantity, pulls its BOM as the source of materials and operations, and schedules work.[4][2]
- The system generates WOs per routing step and assigns them to work centers so operators can start, pause, and complete tasks with time tracking and comments.[8][1]
- As WOs complete, the system records component consumption and finished-good receipts in the ledger, often using backflush based on BOM quantities times completed output.[12][3]
- Dashboards and KPIs update in real time (e.g., throughput, delays, utilization, scrap) so managers and owners can assess status and performance quickly.[10][6]

### Key features mapped to the brief
- Dashboard and filtering: list all MOs with dynamic filters by order state and show quick KPIs aligned to MES best practices.[6][5]
- Manufacturing Orders: create/edit with BOM linkage, work-center routing, deadlines, and progress tracking across execution states.[2][4]
- Work Orders: assign to operators, capture start/pause/complete with durations and notes for granular progress visibility.[1][7]
- Work Centers: manage locations/machines and their utilization/cost context for scheduling and costing.[10][1]
- Stock Ledger: record all issues and receipts; enable backflush to automate component deductions at completion to reduce data entry and errors.[3][12]
- BOMs: define components and operations, and auto-populate MOs/WOs from the selected BOM to ensure recipe and routing consistency.[13][4]

### Dashboards and KPIs
- MES dashboards typically track OEE, downtime, inventory turns, first pass yield, scrap, and rework to measure flow efficiency, quality, and reliability.[5][10]
- Presenting these KPIs in one view lets stakeholders monitor progress and act on bottlenecks or quality issues without mining raw transactions.[14][6]

### Stock posting options and accuracy
- Backflush issues components automatically on completion, streamlining accounting and reducing manual errors in high-velocity environments.[15][3]
- For traceability or exceptions, the ledger still provides line-level postings for issues and receipts, keeping an auditable history of stock movements.[9][12]

### How this solves current pain points
- A single system for BOMs, production orders, work execution, and inventory removes fragmentation and the need to reconcile across spreadsheets.[4][1]
- Real-time WO statuses and MO states give visibility into where work is and what’s delayed, enabling faster decisions and escalations.[6][1]
- Dashboard filters and KPIs provide dynamic monitoring and highlight problems like missed deadlines, low yields, or high downtime.[10][5]
- Automated postings and backflush reduce manual paperwork while keeping the stock ledger up to date for planning and reporting.[3][9]

### Assumed behaviors and guardrails
- Selecting a product’s default BOM auto-populates components and operations for the MO and generates WOs aligned to the routing.[13][4]
- Operators progress WOs at work centers; status transitions and time capture feed dashboards and KPIs for performance and delay analysis.[1][6]
- On WO or MO completion, the system books consumption and receipts (often by backflush), keeping inventory and cost up to date for reporting.[12][3]

If desired next, a build plan can detail screens, endpoints, and SQL for each module (BOM, MO, WO, Work Centers, Ledger, Dashboard) aligned to these flows and KPIs so the first version delivers unified execution and visibility from day one.[6][4]
